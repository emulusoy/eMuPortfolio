My goal is to gain experience and learn. Since I graduated from vocational high school in the field of information technologies, I have always been interested in software. I took courses such as HTML, CSS, SQL, C#, Photoshop. In my university courses, I took many similar courses such as .NET, OOP, C#, Mobile application development. I am willing to constantly improve. I have a small game project in Unity. I have my own website. I also developed many applications on form screen",
